**Objective **

Develop a comprehensive Python script that scrapes real estate data from a Zillow-clone website, processes the data, and enters it into a Google Form using Selenium. This project integrates web scraping, data cleaning, and automated data entry to create a structured dataset.

**Step-by-Step Guide**


Step 1: Set Up Your Google Form

  1. Create a New Google Form:

      Navigate to Google Forms.
      
      Create a new form with the following three short-answer questions:
         a. Property Price
         b. Property Address
         c. Property Link

  3. Get the Form Link: Click on the "Send" button and copy the link to the form. This link will be used to programmatically submit data.


Step 2: Scrape Data from Zillow-Clone Website 

  1. Visit the Zillow-Clone Website: - Go to Zillow-Clone and examine the structure of the web page to identify the data elements. 
  2. Scrape Listings with BeautifulSoup: - Use the requests library to get the HTML content and BeautifulSoup to parse the data. 
  3. Clean Up the Data: - Process the scraped data to remove unnecessary characters and formatting.

Step 3: Automated Data Entry with Selenium

  1. Set Up Selenium: - Install Selenium and set up a WebDriver (e.g., ChromeDriver).
  2. Fill Out the Google Form: - Use Selenium to open the Google Form and fill it out for each listing.
  3. Generate Google Sheet from Form Responses:
      - After submitting all entries, click on the "Sheet" icon in Google Forms to create a Google Sheet with the collected data.

**Prerequisites**

Python 3.x
requests, beautifulsoup4, and selenium libraries (install using pip install requests beautifulsoup4 selenium)
Google Chrome and ChromeDriver (or another WebDriver of your choice)

**Notes**

Ensure to handle exceptions and errors such as network issues, incorrect data extraction, and form submission errors.
Securely store and manage sensitive data, such as form URLs and any necessary credentials.
Be mindful of Google's and the target website's terms of service regarding web scraping and automated actions. By following this guide, you will create a robust Python script capable of scraping real estate data, processing it, and entering it into a Google Form to generate a structured Google Sheet. This project will enhance your skills in web scraping, data cleaning, and automation.
